# Exercise 3 - Immutability of the changesets

This exercise will help you to understand what happens when you try to modify a changeset that has already been executed.

## Steps:
1. Initialize the project folder.
2. Write one or more changesets.
3. Apply the changesets to your database using the `update` command.
4. Edit one of the changesets (already executed) in your changelog file.
5. Run again the `update` command to apply the changes.
6. What results do you get? Why?
